FORMS:

it is nothing but to collect data fraom the end_user and processing it

user forms:
1.create the form
2.use the form in the view
3.create the html that uses the form
4.configure CSRF Token
5.forms in action
6.collecting from data in the view


step1:

configure the template in the settings.py in the project

step2:
 we have to open a forms.py file in the app

in forms app:

from django import forms

class UserReg(forms.Form): 
	firstname=forms.charfield()
	lastname=forms.charfield()
	email =forms
	
it is similar to the creation of the models 


CSRF: cross site request forgery  
{%csrf_token%}

 
2. use the form in the view:
in views
from myapp import forms

def userregistrationview(request):
	a=forms.UserReg
	return render(request,'projectname/functionname.html',{'form':form})

3. create html in the templaplate.
open the forms and open new html file in that form
